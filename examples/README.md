# Examples Folder

This folder contains real-world artifacts and use cases that serve as a foundation for brainstorming and requirements gathering.

## Purpose

The examples in this folder help us:

1. **Ground discussions in reality** - Rather than designing features in the abstract, we reference actual documents, workflows, and scenarios that parishes use today.

2. **Inform requirements** - These artifacts reveal what information needs to be captured, how it's organized, and what outputs users expect.

3. **Guide UI/UX decisions** - Seeing how information is currently presented helps us design interfaces that feel familiar while improving on existing workflows.

4. **Validate implementations** - We can compare our outputs against these real-world examples to ensure we're meeting actual needs.
