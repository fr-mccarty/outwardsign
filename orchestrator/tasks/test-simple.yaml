      This is a simple test task to verify the orchestrator system is working.

      Your task:
      1. Read the orchestrator README.md file
      2. Write a brief summary (2-3 paragraphs) explaining:
         - What the orchestrator does
         - The daily workflow (morning, during day, evening)
         - Key benefits of using the orchestrator
      3. Save your summary to your workspace as 'orchestrator-summary.md'

      Keep it simple and concise. This is just to verify the system works.
