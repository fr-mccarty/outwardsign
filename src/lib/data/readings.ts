He began to teach them, saying: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven.',

Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones, when taking their lamps, brought no oil with them, but the wise brought flasks of oil with their lamps. Since the bridegroom was long delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight, there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him! Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise ones replied, No, for there may not be enough for us and you. Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves. While they went off to buy it, the bridegroom came and those who were ready went to the wedding feast with him. Then the door was locked. Afterwards the other virgins came and said, Lord, Lord, open the door for us! But he said in reply, Amen, I say to you, I do not know you. Therefore, stay awake, for you know neither the day nor the hour.',

Then the king will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me. Then the righteous will answer him and say, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you? And the king will say to them in reply, Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.

Some of the bystanders who heard it said, Look, he is calling Elijah.

The veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. When the centurion who stood facing him saw how he breathed his last he said, Truly this man was the Son of God! When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him. Very early when the sun had risen, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb. They were saying to one another, Who will roll back the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb? When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back; it was very large. On entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were utterly amazed. He said to them, Do not be amazed!

Now there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who, though he was a member of the council, went to Pilate and asked for the Body of Jesus. After he had taken the Body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried. At daybreak on the first day of the week the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb; but when they entered, they did not find the Body of the Lord Jesus. While they were puzzling over this, behold, two men in dazzling garments appeared to them. They were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground. They said to them, Why do you seek the living one among the dead? He is not here, but he has been raised.',

And it happened that while they were conversing and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him. He asked them, What are you discussing as you walk along? They stopped, looking downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, said to him in reply, Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know of the things that have taken place there in these days? And he replied to them, What sort of things? They said to him, The things that happened to Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, how our chief priests and rulers both handed him over to a sentence of death and crucified him. But we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel; and besides all this, it is now the third day since this took place. Some women from our group, however, have astounded us; they were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his Body; they came back and reported that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who announced that he was alive. Then some of those with us went to the tomb and found things just as the women had described, but him they did not see. And he said to them, Oh, how foolish you are! How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory? Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, Jesus interpreted to them what referred to him in all the Scriptures. As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus gave the impression that he was going on farther. But they urged him, Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over. So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but he vanished from their sight. Then they said to each other, Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us? So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem where they found gathered together the Eleven and those with them, who were saying, The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon! Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.',

So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay across it. Jesus said,  Take away the stone. Martha, the dead man sister, said to him,  Lord, by now there will be a stench; he has been dead for four days.

There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle. Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother sister. Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold, your son. Then he said to the disciple, Behold, your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his home. After this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, I thirst. There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth. When Jesus had taken the wine, he said, It is finished. And bowing his head, he handed over the Spirit. Now since it was preparation day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for the Sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs, but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately Blood and water flowed out. An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; he knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you also may come to believe. For this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled: Not a bone of it will be broken. And again another passage says: They will look upon him whom they have pierced. After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the Body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his Body. Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds.',

The thought of my homeless poverty is wormwood and gall; Remembering it over and over leaves my soul downcast within me. But I will call this to mind, as my reason to have hope: The favors of the Lord are not exhausted, his mercies are not spent; They are renewed each morning, so great is his faithfulness. My portion is the Lord, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Good is the Lord to one who waits for him, to the soul that seeks him; It is good to hope in silence for the saving help of the Lord.',

He went about doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree. This man God raised on the third day and granted that he be visible, not to all the people, but to us, the witnesses chosen by God in advance, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commissioned us to preach to the people and testify that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead.

But what a terrible misfortune that such a righteous and charitable man should be afflicted with blindness! He continued to weep in the harms of his kinsman Tobiah. His wife Edna also wept for Tobit; and even their daughter Sarah began to weep. Afterward, Raguel slaughtered a ram from the flock and gave them a cordial reception. When they had bathed and reclined to eat, Tobiah said to Raphael, Brother Azariah, ask Raguel to let me marry my kinswoman Sarah. Raguel overheard the words; so he said to the boy: Eat and drink and be merry tonight, for no man is more entitled to marry my daughter Sarah than you, brother. Besides, not even I have the right to give her to anyone but you, because you are my closest relative. But I will explain the situation to you very frankly. I have given her in marriage to seven men, all of whom were kinsmen of ours, and all died on the very night they approached her. But now, son, eat and drink. I am sure the Lord will look after you both. Tobiah answered, I will eat or drink nothing until you set aside what belongs to me. Raguel said to him: I will do it. She is yours according to the decree of the Book of Moses. Your marriage to her has been decided in heaven! Take your kinswoman; from now on you are her love, and she is your beloved. She is yours today and after. And tonight, my son, may the Lord of heaven prosper you both. May he grant you mercy and peace. Then Raguel called his daughter Sarah, and she came to him. He took her by the hand and gave her to Tobiah with the words: Take her according to the law. According to the decree written in the Book of Moses she is your wife. Take her and bring her back safely to your father. And may the God of heaven grant both of you peace and prosperity. He then called her mother and told her to bring a scroll, so that he might draw up a marriage contract stating that he gave Sarah to Tobiah as his wife according to the decree of the Mosaic law. Her mother brought the scroll, and he drew up the contract, to which they affixed their seals. Afterward they began to eat and drink.',

His mother said to the servers, Do whatever he tells you. Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.

Y entrando en el sepulcro, vieron a un joven sentado al lado derecho, vestido con ropaje blanco; y ellas se asustaron. Pero él les dijo: No os asustéis; buscáis a Jesús nazareno, el crucificado.

Y cuando se acercaba a la puerta de la ciudad, he aquí, sacaban fuera a un muerto, hijo único de su madre, y ella era viuda; y un grupo numeroso de la ciudad estaba con ella. Al verla, el Señor tuvo compasión de ella, y le dijo: No llores. Y acercándose, tocó el féretro; y los que lo llevaban se detuvieron. Y Jesús dijo: Joven, a ti te digo: ¡Levántate! El que había muerto se incorporó y comenzó a hablar, y Jesús se lo entregó a su madre. El temor se apoderó de todos, y glorificaban a Dios, diciendo: Un gran profeta ha surgido entre nosotros, y: Dios ha visitado a su pueblo.

Pero sus ojos estaban velados para que no le reconocieran. Y El les dijo: ¿Qué discusiones son estas que tenéis entre vosotros mientras vais andando? Y ellos se detuvieron, con semblante triste. Respondiendo uno de ellos, llamado Cleofas, le dijo: ¿Eres tú el único visitante en Jerusalén que no sabe las cosas que en ella han acontecido en estos días? Entonces El les dijo: ¿Qué cosas? Y ellos le dijeron: Las referentes a Jesús el Nazareno, que fue un profeta poderoso en obra y en palabra delante de Dios y de todo el pueblo; y cómo los principales sacerdotes y nuestros gobernantes le entregaron a sentencia de muerte y le crucificaron. Pero nosotros esperábamos que El era el que iba a redimir a Israel. Pero además de todo esto, este es el tercer día desde que estas cosas acontecieron. Y también algunas mujeres de entre nosotros nos asombraron; pues cuando fueron de madrugada al sepulcro, y al no hallar su cuerpo, vinieron diciendo que también habían visto una aparición de ángeles que decían que El vivía. Algunos de los que estaban con nosotros fueron al sepulcro, y lo hallaron tal como también las mujeres habían dicho; pero a El no le vieron. Entonces Jesús les dijo: ¡Oh insensatos y tardos de corazón para creer todo lo que los profetas han dicho! ¿No era necesario que el Cristo padeciera todas estas cosas y entrara en su gloria? Y comenzando por Moisés y continuando con todos los profetas, les explicó lo referente a El en todas las Escrituras. Se acercaron a la aldea adonde iban, y El hizo como que iba más lejos. Y ellos le instaron, diciendo: Quédate con nosotros, porque está atardeciendo, y el día ya ha declinado. Y entró a quedarse con ellos. Y sucedió que al sentarse a la mesa con ellos, tomó pan, y lo bendijo; y partiéndolo, les dio. Entonces les fueron abiertos los ojos y le reconocieron; pero El desapareció de la presencia de ellos. Y se dijeron el uno al otro: ¿No ardía nuestro corazón dentro de nosotros mientras nos hablaba en el camino, cuando nos abría las Escrituras? Y levantándose en esa misma hora, regresaron a Jerusalén, y hallaron reunidos a los once y a los que estaban con ellos, que decían: Es verdad que el Señor ha resucitado y se ha aparecido a Simón.

    text: 'En aquel tiempo, un fariseo que era doctor de la ley, le preguntó a Jesús, para ponerlo a prueba: “Maestro, ¿cuál es el mandamiento más grande de la ley?”Jesús le respondió: “Amarás al Señor, tu Dios, con todo tu corazón, con toda tu alma y con toda tu mente. Éste es el más grande y el primero de los mandamientos. Y el segundo es semejante a éste: Amarás a tu prójimo como a ti mismo. En estos dos mandamientos se fundan toda la ley y los profetas”.',

    text: 'En aquel tiempo, hubo una boda en Caná de Galilea, a la cual asistió la madre de Jesús. Éste y sus discípulos también fueron invitados. Como llegara a faltar el vino, María le dijo a Jesús: “Ya no tienen vino”. Jesús le contestó: “Mujer, ¿qué podemos hacer tú y yo? Todavía no llega mi hora”. Pero ella dijo a los que servían: “Hagan lo que él les diga”.Había allí seis tinajas de piedra, de unos cien litros cada una, que ser­vían para las purificaciones de los judíos. Jesús dijo a los que ser­vían: “Llenen de agua esas tinajas”. Y las llenaron hasta el borde. Entonces les dijo: “Saquen ahora un poco y llévenselo al encargado de la fiesta”. Así lo hicieron, y en cuanto el encargado de la fiesta probó el agua convertida en vino, sin saber su procedencia, porque sólo los sirvientes la sabían, llamó al novio y le dijo: “Todo el mundo sirve primero el vino mejor, y cuando los invitados ya han bebido bastante, se sirve el corriente. Tú, en cambio, has guardado el vino mejor hasta ahora”. Esto que hizo Jesús en Caná de Galilea fue el primero de sus signos. Así manifestó su gloria y sus discípulos creyeron en él.',

Yo les he dado la gloria que tú me diste, para que sean uno, como nosotros somos uno. Yo en ellos y tú en mí, para que su unidad sea perfecta y así el mundo conozca que tú me has enviado y que los amas, como me amas a mí. Padre, quiero que donde yo esté, estén también conmigo los que me has dado, para que contemplen mi gloria, la que me diste, porque me has amado desde antes de la creación del mundo. Padre justo, el mundo no te ha conocido; pero yo sí te conozco y éstos han conocido que tú me enviaste. Yo les he dado a conocer tu nombre y se lo seguiré dando a conocer, para que el amor con que me amas esté en ellos y yo también en ellos’’.',
