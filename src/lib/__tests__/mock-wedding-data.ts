My hour has not yet come."\n\nHis mother said to the servers, "Do whatever he tells you."\n\nNow there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.\n\nJesus told them, "Fill the jars with water." So they filled them to the brim.\n\nThen he told them, "Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter." So they took it.\n\nAnd when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from (although the servers who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him, "Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now."\n\nJesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.',
