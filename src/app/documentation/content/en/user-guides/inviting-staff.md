This guide explains how to invite new team members to your parish in Outward Sign.

## Who Can Invite Team Members?

- Create and manage templates
- Access all modules (masses, weddings, funerals, baptisms, etc.)
- Invite team members with any role

**Best for:** Parish priests, parish administrators, IT coordinators

---

### Staff
**Full access to sacramental modules**

Staff members can:
- Access all modules (masses, weddings, funerals, baptisms, etc.)
- Create, edit, and delete all records
- Invite parishioners to the parish
- Cannot manage parish settings or templates

**Best for:** Parish secretaries, liturgical directors, deacons, pastoral associates

---

### Ministry-Leader
**Configurable access to specific modules**

Ministry-leaders can:
- Access only the modules you select when inviting them
- Create, edit, and delete records in their assigned modules
- Cannot invite anyone or manage parish settings

**Available modules to assign:**

## Managing Pending Invitations

### View Pending Invitations

In Parish Settings > Team Management, you'll see a list of pending invitations showing:
- Email address
- Role
- Modules (if ministry-leader)
- Expiration date
- Who sent the invitation

### Resend an Invitation

If someone didn't receive the invitation or it expired:

1. Find the invitation in the **Pending Invitations** list
2. Click **Resend**
3. A new invitation email will be sent with a new 7-day expiration

**Note:** The old invitation link will no longer work after resending.

### Revoke an Invitation

If you sent an invitation by mistake:

1. Find the invitation in the **Pending Invitations** list
2. Click **Revoke**
3. The invitation link will become invalid
4. The person will not be able to accept it

---

## Invitation Expiration

- All invitations expire **7 days** after being sent
- After expiration, the invitation link will not work
- Use the **Resend** button to send a new invitation

---

## Changing Someone's Role

**Important:** Roles cannot be changed after someone accepts an invitation.

To give someone a different role:
1. Remove them from the parish (Parish Settings > Team Management > Remove)
2. Send a new invitation with the desired role

**Why roles are permanent:**
- Prevents accidental privilege escalation
- Creates a clear audit trail
- Simplifies permission management
