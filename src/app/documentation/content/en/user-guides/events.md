# Creating Events

Learn how to create and manage calendar events in Outward Sign.

## Overview

Events in Outward Sign are calendar entries that help you schedule and track parish activities. Events can be:

- **Standalone calendar items** - Parish meetings, social events, committee gatherings
- **Linked to sacramental celebrations** - Weddings, funerals, baptisms, masses

## Understanding Events vs. Sacramental Records

**Important Distinction:**

- **Events** (Calendar module) - Scheduling and date/time/location information
- **Sacramental Records** (Weddings, Funerals, Baptisms, etc.) - Complete liturgical planning, readings, ministers, scripts

Many sacramental celebrations have multiple associated events:
- A wedding might have: rehearsal event, ceremony event, reception event
- A funeral might have: vigil event, funeral mass event, committal event

## Creating a New Event

### Method 1: From the Calendar

1. Navigate to **Calendar** in the sidebar
2. Click on a date or click **Create Event**
3. Fill in event details
4. Click **Save**

### Method 2: From a Sacramental Module

When creating a wedding, funeral, or other sacramental celebration, you can create associated events directly within that module. This automatically links the event to the sacramental record.

## Event Information

- **Status** - Scheduled, Confirmed, Completed, Cancelled

### Date and Time

- **Start Date/Time** - When the event begins
- **End Date/Time** - When the event ends
- **All Day** - Check if this is an all-day event

### Location

## Liturgical Calendar Integration

Outward Sign includes the Catholic liturgical calendar with all solemnities, feasts, and memorials. These appear automatically on your calendar and cannot be edited (but you can create associated events, like scheduling a specific Mass for a Holy Day).

**Liturgical calendar features:**
- Solemnities (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, etc.)
- Feasts of the Lord, Mary, and saints
- Liturgical seasons (Advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter, Ordinary Time)
- Liturgical colors

## Event Conflicts and Scheduling

### Checking for Conflicts

When creating an event, Outward Sign will alert you if:
- The location is already booked at that time
- A presider is assigned to multiple celebrations
- Ministers have scheduling conflicts

### Resolving Conflicts

- **Adjust time** - Move the event to a different time slot
- **Change location** - Use a different venue
- **Reassign ministers** - Find alternate ministers for one celebration

## Recurring Events

For regularly scheduled events (weekly meetings, daily Masses):

1. Create the initial event
2. Check **Recurring Event**
3. Select pattern:
   - Daily
   - Weekly (choose days of week)
   - Monthly (choose date or day of month)
4. Set end date or number of occurrences

Recurring events can be edited individually or as a series.

## Best Practices

### Planning Ahead

- **Create events early** - Schedule at least 2-4 weeks in advance
- **Confirm details** - Verify dates, times, and locations
- **Check availability** - Ensure ministers and locations are available

### Communication

- **Share calendar** - Export to staff calendars
- **Update promptly** - Make changes as soon as you know about them
- **Include contact info** - Always add a contact person for events

### Organization

- **Use consistent naming** - "Last Name - Event Type" (e.g., "Johnson Wedding")
- **Add descriptions** - Include helpful context in the description field
- **Mark status** - Keep event status current (confirmed, completed, etc.)
