# Support the Project

Outward Sign is built and supported by contributors who use this tool in their own parishes. We're not looking for outside contributions from people who aren't actively using the tool—but if you're a parish using Outward Sign and want to help make it better, we'd love your support.

The best way to support this project is to use it, and then share your feedback and ideas with us. If you'd also like to contribute financially to help sustain and grow this tool, we welcome that as well.
