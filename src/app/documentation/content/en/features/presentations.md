# Presentations

Celebrate the Presentation of the Lord with families in your parish.

## Overview

The Presentations module helps you manage the beautiful tradition of presenting children in the temple, following the example of Mary and Joseph presenting the infant Jesus. This sacramental celebration is especially important in Latino Catholic communities and is often called "Presentación del Niño" or simply "Presentation."

## What is a Presentation?

The Presentation of a child is a blessing ceremony where parents present their child to God in the Church, asking for God's protection and blessing. This tradition is based on:

- **Luke 2:22-40** - Mary and Joseph presenting Jesus in the temple
- **Cultural tradition** - Particularly valued in Latino Catholic culture
- **Parental blessing** - Parents dedicating their child to God

**Important Note:** A Presentation is not a substitute for Baptism. Ideally, the child should already be baptized, though Presentations can sometimes be combined with Baptism preparation.

## Presentation vs. Baptism

It's important to understand the difference:

### Presentation
- **Blessing ceremony**, not a sacrament
- Based on cultural tradition
- Parents present child to God
- Can be performed by priest, deacon, or lay minister
- Not required by Church law
- Does not remove original sin
- Beautiful tradition but not essential for salvation

### Baptism
- **Sacrament of initiation**
- Required by Church teaching
- Removes original sin
- Incorporates person into Church
- Must be performed by ordained minister (except emergency)
- Essential for salvation (ordinary means)
- Confers grace

**Both are important but different.** Ideally, a child is baptized first, then presented later as a blessing and dedication by parents.

## Common Scenarios

### Already Baptized Child

Most common scenario:
1. Child was baptized as infant
2. Parents want additional blessing and dedication
3. Presentation ceremony celebrates parental commitment
4. Beautiful way to involve community in child's spiritual growth

### Not Yet Baptized

If child is not baptized:
1. Explain importance of baptism as sacrament
2. Schedule baptism preparation class
3. May celebrate presentation now as cultural tradition
4. Schedule baptism separately (do not delay)
5. Presentation is not substitute for baptism

### Group Presentations

Multiple families celebrating together:
1. Schedule one ceremony for several families
2. Create separate presentation record for each child
3. Coordinate all families
4. Ceremony may be longer
5. Beautiful community celebration

### Presentation During Mass

Celebrating presentation within Mass:
1. Coordinate with scheduled Mass
2. Presentation happens after homily (typically)
3. Or during concluding rites
4. Brief ceremony (5-10 minutes)
5. Announce in parish bulletin

## Cultural Significance

Presentations hold special meaning in Latino Catholic communities:

### Traditional Elements

- **Family gathering** - Extended family often attends
- **Special clothing** - Child often dressed in white or special outfit
