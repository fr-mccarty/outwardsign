# Groups

Organize and manage ministry groups and their members in your parish.

## Overview

The Groups module helps you organize parish ministries, committees, and teams. Track which parishioners belong to which groups, assign roles within groups, and maintain an organized directory of all group members. This module focuses on group membership management rather than scheduling or task coordination.

## What are Groups?

## Integration with Other Modules

### People Module

Groups rely on the People directory:

- Members must exist as person records first

- Updating person info automatically updates in groups

### Mass Role Members

For liturgical scheduling, use **Mass Role Members** instead of Groups:

- Mass Role Members includes availability preferences
- Tracks blackout dates and assignment history
- Designed specifically for Mass scheduling

**Groups** = General membership ("Who belongs to the choir?")
**Mass Role Members** = Scheduling ("When can each lector serve?")

## Best Practices

### Group Organization

- **Clear Names** - Use descriptive, consistent group names
- **Good Descriptions** - Explain each group's purpose
- **Regular Updates** - Review memberships at least annually
- **Archive Inactive** - Mark old groups inactive rather than deleting

### Role Management

- **Consistent Roles** - Use the same role names across similar groups
- **Assign Coordinators** - Every group should have at least one coordinator
- **Document Responsibilities** - Use description field to clarify roles
- **Update Promptly** - Change roles when leadership transitions

### Membership Tracking

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between Groups and Group Members?**
A: **Groups** is where you manage the groups themselves (create, edit, view groups). **Group Members** is a directory view focused on people and which groups they belong to.

**Q: Can one person belong to multiple groups?**
A: Yes! People can belong to as many groups as appropriate.

**Q: Can I schedule meetings with Groups?**
A: No, Groups is only for membership tracking. Use the **Events** module to schedule meetings and gatherings.

**Q: What's the difference between Groups and Mass Role Members?**
A: **Groups** tracks membership only. **Mass Role Members** is specifically for liturgical scheduling and includes availability, preferences, and assignment tracking.

**Q: Can group members see each other's contact info?**
A: That depends on your parish's permission settings and how you share the information. Outward Sign tracks the data, but you control who sees it.

**Q: How do I email all members of a group?**
A: Outward Sign doesn't have built-in email. Export the member list and use it to create a distribution list in your email system.

**Q: Should I delete inactive groups?**
A: No, mark them inactive instead. This preserves historical records and allows reactivation if needed.

**Q: Can I assign multiple roles to one person in a group?**
A: Not directly. If someone has multiple responsibilities, you might create a role like "Coordinator & Secretary" or note it in their person record.
