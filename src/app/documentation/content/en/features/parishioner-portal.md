# Parishioner Portal

A mobile-friendly web app for parishioners to view their ministry schedule, chat with an AI assistant, and receive parish notifications.

## Overview

The Parishioner Portal is designed for members of your parish who participate in ministries and events. Unlike the main Outward Sign application (which is for staff), the Parishioner Portal provides a simple, focused experience for viewing your personal commitments and staying connected with the parish.

## Who Is This For?

The Parishioner Portal is for:

- Ministry volunteers (lectors, altar servers, musicians, etc.)
- Parish members involved in groups or committees
- Anyone who wants to stay informed about their parish commitments

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Portal

1. Your parish administrator will invite you to the portal
2. You will receive an email with a magic link
3. Click the link in your email to access your portal
4. The link will log you in automatically - no password needed

### Magic Link Login

The Parishioner Portal uses a secure, password-free login system:

- Each time you want to access the portal, request a magic link
- Enter your email address on the login page
- Check your email for the magic link (it should arrive within a few minutes)
- Click the link to access your portal
- The link expires after 48 hours for security

**Tip:** The magic link can only be used once. If you need to log in again, request a new link.

## Portal Features

The Parishioner Portal has three main tabs:

### 1. Calendar Tab

You can mark dates when you're unavailable to serve in your ministry:

### 2. Chat Tab

Talk to an AI assistant that knows your parish schedule and can answer questions about your commitments.

**Note:** The AI assistant has access to your personal schedule and family data. It provides helpful answers but is not a substitute for contacting parish staff with important questions or changes.
