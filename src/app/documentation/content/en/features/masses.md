# Managing Mass Intentions

Learn how to manage Mass intentions and daily Mass scheduling in Outward Sign.

## Overview

The Masses module helps you organize and track:
- Daily and Sunday Mass schedules
- Mass intentions (offered for specific people or intentions)
- Presiders and liturgical ministers
- Special celebrations and solemnities

## Understanding Mass Intentions

Mass intentions are specific prayers or remembrances for which a Mass is offered. Common types include:

- **For the Deceased** - Remembering someone who has passed away
- **For the Living** - Special intentions (healing, thanksgiving, birthdays)
- **For an Anniversary** - Wedding anniversaries, death anniversaries
- **General Intentions** - Parish, diocesan, or universal needs

## Creating a Mass Record

1. Navigate to **Masses** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Mass**
3. Fill in the Mass details:
   - **Date and Time** - When the Mass will be celebrated
   - **Type** - Sunday Mass, Daily Mass, Holy Day, Special Celebration
   - **Language** - English, Spanish, Latin, or Bilingual
   - **Location** - Which church or chapel

4. **Link to Liturgical Calendar Event** (optional)
   - Automatically pulls readings for the day
   - Shows liturgical season and color

5. **Add Presider** - Assign the celebrating priest or deacon

## Adding Mass Intentions

- **Homilist** - Who will preach (if different from presider)
- **Deacon** - Assisting deacon (if applicable)
- **Lectors** - Readers for first reading, second reading, prayers
