# Managing Masses

Plan and celebrate individual Mass liturgies in your parish.

## Overview

The Masses module helps you create and manage individual Mass celebrations throughout the liturgical year. Whether it's a Sunday Mass, daily Mass, Holy Day celebration, or special liturgy, this module tracks all the details needed for reverent and well-prepared celebrations.

**Note:** This documentation covers creating and managing individual Mass celebrations. For recurring Mass schedules, see [Mass Scheduling](./mass-scheduling). For tracking Mass intention requests, see [Mass Intentions](./mass-intentions).

## What is a Mass Record?

A Mass record in Outward Sign represents a single celebration of the Eucharist and includes:

- **Basic Information** - Date, time, location, type
- **Liturgical Context** - Liturgical calendar link, readings, season
- **Ministers** - Presider, deacon, homilist, other liturgical roles
- **Petitions** - Prayer of the Faithful intentions
- **Mass Intentions** - People or intentions for which the Mass is offered
- **Notes** - Special instructions or circumstances

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How far in advance should I create Mass records?**
A: For regular Sunday/daily Masses, 2-4 weeks is typical. For Holy Days, plan as soon as the date is known (months in advance).

**Q: What if the scheduled presider is unavailable?**
A: Simply edit the Mass record and assign a different presider. Notify affected parties of the change.

**Q: Can I create multiple Masses at once?**
A: Yes, use the Mass Scheduling system to generate recurring Masses from templates. See [Mass Scheduling](./mass-scheduling).

**Q: What if readings are different from what shows in the liturgical calendar?**
A: You can manually override readings for special circumstances (votive Mass, Mass for special need, etc.).

**Q: How do I handle bilingual Masses?**
A: Set the language to "Bilingual" and note in the description or notes which parts are in which language.

**Q: Should I create a Mass record for every Sunday Mass?**
A: Yes, especially if you assign ministers, track intentions, or need printed scripts. If your parish uses Mass Scheduling, this can be automated.

**Q: What's the difference between a Mass record and a Mass intention?**
A: A Mass record represents the celebration itself (when, where, who celebrates). A Mass intention is a specific prayer or remembrance linked to that Mass.

**Q: Can I edit a Mass after it's been celebrated?**
A: Yes, you can edit for accuracy of records, but the Mass status should remain "Completed."
