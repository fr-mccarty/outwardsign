# Baptisms

Plan and celebrate the Sacrament of Baptism in your parish.

## Overview

The Baptisms module helps you manage all aspects of baptismal celebrations, from initial contact with families through the ceremony itself. Track candidates, godparents, witnesses, and all liturgical details in one place.

## Creating a Baptism

### Step 1: Basic Information

1. Navigate to **Baptisms** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Baptism**
3. Enter the following information:
   - **Baptismal Name** - Full name the person will be baptized with
   - **Status** - Planning, Active, Completed, Cancelled
   - **Language** - English, Spanish, or Latin
   - **Notes** - Internal notes for staff

### Step 2: The Candidate

Add information about the person being baptized:

- **Person** - Select from parish directory or create new person
- **Date of Birth** - Birth date of the candidate
- **Place of Birth** - City, state, country where born
- **Baptism Type** - Infant, Child, or Adult baptism

### Step 3: Parents

Record information about the candidate's parents:

- **Father** - Select or create person record
- **Mother** - Select or create person record
- **Marital Status** - Married in Church, Civilly Married, Unmarried, etc.

This information is important for baptismal certificates and records.

### Step 4: Godparents and Witnesses

#### Godparents

Catholic teaching requires at least one godparent:

- **Godfather** - Male godparent (optional)
- **Godmother** - Female godparent (optional)
- Must have at least one godparent
- Godparents must be confirmed, practicing Catholics

#### Witnesses

Additional witnesses may be present:

- **Add Witness** - Click to add Christian witnesses
- Witnesses do not need to be Catholic
- Not required but may be recorded

### Step 5: Event Details

Add up to four events related to the baptism:

- **Baptism Ceremony** - The sacramental celebration (required)
- **Baptism Preparation Class** - Pre-baptism catechesis
- **Reception** - Post-ceremony celebration
- **Additional Event** - Any other related gathering

For each event, specify:

1. **First Reading** - Old Testament reading (optional)
2. **Responsorial Psalm** - Sung or spoken psalm
3. **Second Reading** - New Testament reading (optional)

Some baptisms use a simplified liturgy with fewer readings. Consult your presider.

## Common Scenarios

### Baptism During Sunday Mass

When baptism is celebrated during a parish Mass:
1. Coordinate with the scheduled Mass presider
2. Inform music ministry of baptismal hymns
3. Brief lectors about any special readings
4. Prepare baptismal area in church
5. Announce baptism in parish bulletin

### Private Baptism

For baptisms outside of Mass:
1. Schedule separate ceremony time
2. Simpler liturgy without full Mass
3. Typically 30-45 minutes
4. More intimate setting for family

### Group Baptisms

When celebrating baptism for multiple children together in a single ceremony:

**Using the Group Baptisms Module:**
1. Navigate to **Group Baptisms** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Group Baptism** and provide:
   - Group name (e.g., "November 2025 Group Baptism")
   - Ceremony event details (date, time, location)
   - Presider for the group
3. Add baptisms to the group:
   - **Link existing baptisms** - Select individual baptism records already created
   - **Create new baptisms inline** - Add children directly within the group
4. Generate a combined ceremony script showing all children and families
5. Print or export the group baptism document for the presider

**Benefits of Group Baptisms:**
- Single liturgical script listing all children being baptized
- Coordinated event details for multiple families
- Clear roster of all participants for the presider
- Streamlined preparation for ceremonies with several baptisms

Each child still has their own individual baptism record for sacramental documentation, but the group baptism provides a unified ceremony experience and script.

### Emergency Baptism

In cases of serious illness or danger of death:
1. Any baptized person can perform baptism
2. Use simplified formula: "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"
3. Pour water over head while saying words
4. Record baptism and report to parish
5. Complete remaining ceremonies when possible (if person recovers)
