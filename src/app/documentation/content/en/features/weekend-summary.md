# Weekend Summary

Generate a comprehensive summary of all parish activities scheduled for a weekend.

## Overview

The Weekend Summary is a powerful tool that creates a single document showing everything happening at your parish from Saturday morning through Sunday afternoon. This document serves as a quick reference for priests, deacons, and parish staff to stay informed about all scheduled activities.

## What's Included

The Weekend Summary can include:

1. **Sacraments** - Weddings, Baptisms, Funerals, Presentations, Quinceañeras
2. **Masses** - All scheduled Masses with times, locations, and presiders
3. **Mass Roles** - Liturgical minister assignments (lectors, servers, musicians, etc.)

## When to Use Weekend Summary

### Weekly Planning Meeting
Review upcoming weekend activities with your parish team before the weekend begins.

### Sacristy Reference
Print the summary and place it on the sacristy counter as a quick reference throughout the weekend.

### Schedule Coordination
Check for potential timing conflicts between different events and ensure adequate coverage.

### Post-Weekend Review
Generate summaries for past weekends to review activity levels and track sacramental celebrations.

## Creating a Weekend Summary

### Step 1: Navigate to Weekend Summary

1. Click **Weekend Summary** in the sidebar
2. You'll see the setup page with configuration options

### Step 2: Select the Weekend Date

1. Click the calendar picker to select a date
2. **Important:** Only Sundays can be selected
3. The system automatically includes the previous Saturday
4. Example: Select Sunday, November 24 → includes Saturday, November 23 and Sunday, November 24

### Step 3: Choose What to Include

Three checkboxes let you customize what appears in your summary:

- **☑ Include Sacraments** - Shows all weddings, baptisms, funerals, presentations, and quinceañeras

**All three are checked by default.** Uncheck any section you don't need.

### Step 4: Generate the Summary

Click the **"Generate Weekend Summary"** button.

The system will:
1. Find all activities scheduled for that weekend
2. Organize them by category
3. Display a formatted document with all the information

## Understanding Empty Sections

If a section shows "No [activities] scheduled," this means:
- **No Sacraments** - No weddings, baptisms, funerals, etc. are scheduled
- **No Masses** - No Masses have been entered in the system for this weekend
- **No Mass Roles** - No liturgical ministers have been assigned yet

This is normal and simply indicates there are no activities of that type scheduled.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I edit the Weekend Summary after generating it?**
A: No, the Weekend Summary is read-only. To make changes, update the individual events (weddings, masses, etc.), then regenerate the summary.

**Q: Why can I only select Sundays?**
A: The system is designed around liturgical weekends. Selecting a Sunday automatically includes the preceding Saturday for a complete weekend view.

**Q: What if we have activities on Friday evening?**
A: The Weekend Summary only covers Saturday-Sunday. Friday evening events would need to be viewed separately in the calendar or individual module.

**Q: Can I customize which sacraments appear?**
A: You can include or exclude the entire Sacraments section, but you cannot pick specific sacrament types. All scheduled sacraments for the weekend will appear if the section is included.

**Q: How far in advance can I generate a summary?**
A: You can generate a Weekend Summary for any date - past, present, or future. The summary will show whatever is currently scheduled in the system for that weekend.

**Q: Will the summary update automatically if I make changes?**
A: No, you need to regenerate the summary to see updated information. The document shows a snapshot of data at the time it was generated.

**Q: Can I include custom notes or announcements?**
A: The Weekend Summary pulls data directly from the system. To add custom content, download the Word document and edit it, or add notes to the individual Mass or event records.
