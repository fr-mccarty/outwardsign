# Mass Intentions

Track and fulfill Mass intention requests in your parish.

## Overview

The Mass Intentions module helps you manage the important ministry of receiving, tracking, and fulfilling Mass intention requests from parishioners and families. Mass intentions are specific prayers or remembrances for which a Mass is offered, and this module ensures every request is properly recorded and honored.

## What is a Mass Intention?

A Mass intention is a specific person or intention for whom the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is offered. The practice of offering Mass for specific intentions dates back to the early Church and is a powerful way to remember loved ones and pray for special needs.

### Common Types of Mass Intentions

- **For the Deceased** - Most common; offering Mass for the repose of the soul of someone who has died
- **For the Living** - Prayers for healing, thanksgiving, birthdays, anniversaries
- **In Thanksgiving** - Gratitude for blessings, answered prayers, special occasions
- **Special Intentions** - Marriage, vocations, family needs, guidance
- **Anniversaries** - Death anniversaries, wedding anniversaries, ordination anniversaries

### Theological Understanding

- Mass is the greatest prayer the Church can offer
- The infinite merits of Christ's sacrifice benefit the person or intention
- Offering Mass for someone is a profound act of charity and love
- Stipends (donations) support priests and the Church's mission
