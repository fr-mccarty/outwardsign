# Marketing Plan: Outward Sign

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-10
**Product:** Outward Sign - Sacrament & Sacramental Management for Catholic Parishes
**Website:** outwardsign.church

---

## Executive Summary

Outward Sign is a free, open-source sacrament and sacramental management tool designed to help Catholic parishes plan, prepare, and celebrate liturgical events with excellence. Our marketing strategy focuses on reaching three key decision-makers in mid-sized Catholic parishes (300-1000 families): parish priests, pastoral associates, and business managers.

**Core Challenge:** Converting cautious, busy parish leaders who are skeptical of "too good to be true" free software into confident, active users.

**Marketing Focus:** Build trust through social proof, demonstrate concrete ROI, and address the unique concerns of each decision-maker persona.

**Funding Model:** Rather than charging parishes or seeking venture capital, Outward Sign is funded through sponsorship from Catholic organizations (publishers, foundations, tech companies, church suppliers, media outlets, and apostolates) who want to reach and serve parish communities. This creates a sustainable win-win: parishes get excellent free software, sponsors gain meaningful brand visibility with highly engaged parish leaders, and the Church is better equipped for sacramental excellence.

**Year 1 Goal:** Secure $50K-75K in sponsorship revenue and reach 100 active parishes, demonstrating value to both sponsors and parish users.

## Target Audience

### Primary Target: Mid-Sized Catholic Parishes

**Profile:**
- 300-1,000 registered families
- 1-2 priests/deacons
- 5-15 staff members
- Annual operating budget: $500K-$2M
- Managing 15-40 weddings, 10-30 funerals, 20-50 baptisms annually
- Current tools: Scattered spreadsheets, email, Word documents, paper files

**Geographic Focus:**
- United States (English-speaking parishes) - Primary
- Spanish-speaking parishes in US - Secondary
- English/Spanish-speaking countries - Future expansion

**Decision-Making Unit:**

Three key personas must all approve adoption:

### 1. **The Parish Priest** (Fr. Michael Thompson)
- **Role:** Final decision-maker, primary user for celebration
- **Pain Points:** Overwhelmed schedule, budget anxiety, needs simple tools
- **Decision Criteria:** "Will this make my life easier or harder?"
- **Persuasion Level:** 6/10 - Interested but cautious

### 2. **The Pastoral Associate** (Teresa Rodriguez)
- **Role:** Operational manager, primary day-to-day user
- **Pain Points:** Perfectionism, anxiety, needs control and organization
- **Decision Criteria:** "Can I maintain quality while reducing stress?"
- **Persuasion Level:** 7/10 - Excited but nervous

### 3. **The Business Manager** (Carmen Santos)
- **Role:** Financial gatekeeper, ROI evaluator
- **Pain Points:** Budget scrutiny, sustainability concerns, implementation costs
- **Decision Criteria:** "What's the total cost of ownership and ROI?"
- **Persuasion Level:** 5/10 - Skeptical but open-minded

**Critical Insight:** All three must be convinced. If Carmen blocks it for budget/risk reasons, Fr. Michael won't override her. If Teresa thinks it's too complicated, Fr. Michael won't push adoption.

- Allow parishes to keep old systems during trial
- Celebrate small successes

### Risk 3: Budget Concerns Despite Being Free

**Mitigation:**

- No hidden costs messaging
- Compare to paid alternatives
- Show staff hour savings = real money

### Risk 4: Competing with Established Parish Management Systems

- Emphasize quality of liturgy preparation features
- Integration capabilities (calendar export, etc.)
- Free = try alongside existing tools
- Focus on what we do uniquely well

### Risk 5: Sustainability Questions

**Mitigation:**

- Bootstrap with minimal essential tools
- Pursue in-kind sponsorships (hosting, design, legal)
- Diverse sponsor categories (not over-reliant on one sector)
- Long sales cycle factored into Year 1 timeline
- Alternative: Small grants from Catholic foundations
- Backup: Individual donor/supporter program

### Risk 7: Mission Drift from Sponsor Influence

**Risk:** Sponsors attempt to influence product roadmap or compromise mission

**Mitigation:**
- Clear sponsorship guidelines and ethics (documented above)
- Sponsors don't get product roadmap input
- Editorial independence maintained
- Right to decline/terminate misaligned sponsors
- Parish advisory board reviews sponsor relationships
- Annual transparency report
- Open-source nature prevents vendor lock-in

### Risk 8: Sponsor Concentration Risk

**Risk:** Over-dependence on single sponsor (if they leave, major revenue loss)

**Mitigation:**
- Target: No single sponsor >30% of revenue
- Diversify across 6 sponsor categories
- Multi-year contracts with notice periods
- Build reserve fund (6 months operating expenses goal)
- Continuous sponsor pipeline development
