# The Diocesan Bishop

**Bishop James Kowalski** leads the Diocese of Prairie Falls, a sprawling rural diocese in the upper Midwest with 62 parishes serving approximately 45,000 Catholics—a small Catholic population scattered across a vast geographic area. At 68, he's been a bishop for nine years, following twenty-five years as a parish priest in a mid-sized diocese where he also served as vicar for clergy. That administrative experience prepared him for the episcopacy, though nothing fully prepares you for the weight of leading a diocese.

Bishop Kowalski is well-regarded by his staff, a pastoral shepherd who found himself becoming more of a manager than he ever anticipated. He's not a visionary leader pushing bold initiatives—he's a steady hand trying to keep a struggling diocese afloat. His leadership style falls somewhere between avoidant and direct; he doesn't seek out conflict, but he won't run from it when it arrives at his door. And conflict arrives regularly.

Two things occupy most of his mental bandwidth: money and fires. The diocese operates on thin margins, and his finance director—a capable but perpetually cautious guardian of the finances—reminds him of this constantly. Bishop Kowalski has learned to joke about it, but the financial anxiety is real. Schools are a particular concern: each one represents both a treasured ministry and a potential budget crisis. Staffing parishes is equally pressing—with only 40 active priests for 62 parishes, he relies heavily on international priests to fill the gaps. A few parishes have already merged, and he knows more consolidation is coming.

The "fires" are mostly internal. The diocesan health insurance program has become a point of contention, and some employees feel the diocese hasn't communicated well about changes. People are unhappy with how problems are being handled, and those complaints land on his desk. He's not facing media scandals or Roman interventions—just the grinding reality of people who are hurting and looking to him for answers he doesn't always have.

Technology is not Bishop Kowalski's language. He's a self-aware Luddite who leaves software decisions to people closer to the ground. If a parish wants to use some new system for sacramental preparation, that's fine—it's not his concern unless it creates problems. His interest in a tool like Outward Sign would be purely practical: if it reduces complaints from pastors and helps parish staff do their jobs better, he's supportive. He's particularly open to it because one of his priests is involved in developing it, and he trusts his priests to know what parishes need.

His weeks follow a predictable rhythm: days at the chancery working through administrative matters, weekends driving across the diocese for confirmations. Those confirmation Masses are what energize him—seeing young people affirm their faith, laying hands on them, connecting with parish communities. It's the closest he gets to his old life as a parish priest, and he genuinely enjoys it. He also enjoys prayer and doesn't feel guilty about the administrative work that fills his days; he's made peace with the fact that this is his ministry now.

Bishop Kowalski is fortunate to have a strong vicar general—an organized, personable priest who helps move projects forward and handles much of the operational complexity. Without him, the diocese would struggle even more. He leans on this support heavily.

At 68, retirement is still some years away, but he thinks about it. Canon law requires him to submit his resignation at 75, and he's aware that day will come. He doesn't talk publicly about succession, and there's no obvious heir apparent. What he hopes to leave behind is a diocese that's stable enough for whoever comes next—though he's realistic about the challenges his successor will inherit. The finances will still be tight, the priest shortage will still be acute, and the personnel concerns won't have disappeared. But perhaps the fires will be a little smaller, the parishes a little more prepared, and the people a little more at peace. That would be enough.
