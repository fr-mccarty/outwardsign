# The Parish Priest

**Fr. Michael Thompson** is the pastor of St. Joseph Parish, a mid-sized Catholic church serving approximately 600 families in a suburban community. He oversees a pastoral team that includes two deacons who assist with sacramental preparation and liturgical ministry, plus a staff of 10 people covering religious education, youth ministry, music, administration, and maintenance. His days are packed with Mass celebrations, counseling sessions, hospital visits, administrative meetings, and endless emails. He juggles wedding preparations, baptism classes, funeral planning, and the regular rhythm of parish life, all while trying to maintain his own prayer life and stay connected to his community.

Fr. Michael wants to do excellent work and provide meaningful sacramental experiences for his parishioners, but he often feels stretched thin. The parish budget is perpetually a bit behind where he'd like it to be, creating low-level anxiety about expenses and staffing. He's a naturally social person—parishioners genuinely like him, appreciating his warmth and accessibility—though he knows his preaching is competent rather than inspiring. What he needs most is systems that help him and his team stay organized, communicate effectively, and ensure that nothing falls through the cracks when preparing families for life's most sacred moments. He doesn't have time to learn complicated software, but he desperately needs better tools than the scattered spreadsheets, paper files, and email threads that currently govern sacramental preparation at St. Joseph's.
