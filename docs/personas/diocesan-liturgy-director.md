# The Diocesan Liturgy Director

**Fr. David Okonkwo** is in his early fifties and serves as pastor of a parish in a rural area while also holding the part-time position of director of the diocesan Office of Worship—a role he took on three years ago because no one else was available and the bishop asked. He didn't design the position, but he's made it work alongside his parish responsibilities.

Fr. David has traditional liturgical sensibilities and an appreciation for beauty in worship. He cares about sacred art, quality vestments, and dignified liturgical spaces—when a parish in the diocese undertook a renovation recently, he was glad to offer input on the sanctuary design. Proper materials, appropriate colors, reverent atmosphere: these things matter to him because he believes the liturgy deserves care and attention.

His demeanor is pastoral but measured. He's approachable enough that people feel comfortable asking him liturgical questions, but there's a thoughtfulness to him, a sense that he considers things carefully before responding. He's done some video content for the diocese over the years—short reflections during liturgical seasons—and brings that same deliberate quality to his work.

As diocesan liturgy director, Fr. David doesn't put out many fires. He's not constantly traveling the diocese or doing proactive formation work; his primary ministry remains his parish, and the diocesan role fits around that. When issues arise—inconsistent practices across parishes, poorly trained liturgical ministers, questionable music choices, priests who improvise rather than follow the rubrics—he notices, and it concerns him. But he's realistic about what a part-time director can actually address. He does what he can and accepts the rest.

Fr. David is comfortable enough with technology but doesn't seek it out. He can use what he needs to use, but he's not an early adopter, and he approaches new tools with skepticism. His first instinct when someone pitches a new software solution is to wonder whether it will actually help or just add complexity. He's seen plenty of initiatives come and go.

That said, Fr. David is open to being convinced. He's not going to be the first diocese to adopt something new—that's not his style—but if he sees a few parishes already using a tool successfully, his skepticism softens. If other liturgy directors speak well of it, or if a bishop mentions it approvingly, he'll take a serious look. He's prudent, watching to see what works before committing. He won't lead a charge, but once momentum builds, he'll join it.

For a tool like Outward Sign, winning Fr. David over means demonstrating real-world usefulness at the parish level—ideally in parishes he knows. If his own parish staff found it helpful for sacramental preparation, that would matter. If a neighboring diocese's liturgy director recommended it, that would matter more. He doesn't need much convincing once social proof exists; he just won't be the one to go first.

What Fr. David ultimately wants is for the liturgy to be celebrated beautifully and correctly across his diocese, with well-prepared ministers and reverent celebrations. Any tool that genuinely serves that goal—without creating more work or more problems—would eventually earn his support. He just needs to see it working somewhere else first.
