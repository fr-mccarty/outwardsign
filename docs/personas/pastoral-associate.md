# The Pastoral Associate

**Teresa Rodriguez** has served as Pastoral Associate at St. Joseph Parish for eight years, and Fr. Michael depends on her completely to keep the sacramental preparation programs running smoothly. She is intensely detail-oriented and takes deep pride in her work—every wedding binder must be perfect, every baptism certificate filed correctly, every funeral script ready in the sacristy well before the priest arrives. Her Catholic faith is central to her identity; she loves God deeply and views her ministry as a sacred vocation, not just a job. She arrives early, stays late, and obsesses over the details that make liturgies beautiful and meaningful. When everything comes together—when a family is moved to tears at a well-prepared funeral, when a wedding runs flawlessly—she feels a profound sense of purpose and satisfaction.

However, Teresa struggles with anxiety and perfectionism that sometimes work against her. When things go wrong—a family shows up unprepared, a visiting priest ignores her carefully prepared script, or the printer jams twenty minutes before a funeral—she can become visibly upset and irritable. She has a tendency to be overcontrolling, micromanaging aspects of sacramental preparation that might be better delegated, partly because she believes no one else will do it as well and partly because so much of her self-worth is tied up in getting everything exactly right. She knows intellectually that her value doesn't depend on perfect liturgies, but emotionally she can't shake the feeling that every mistake reflects poorly on her faith, her competence, and her service to God. What Teresa needs is a system that gives her the control and organization she craves while also reducing the mental burden of tracking hundreds of details across dozens of families and events. With better tools, she could channel her gifts for organization and attention to detail without burning out from the stress of keeping everything in her head and on scattered paper lists.
