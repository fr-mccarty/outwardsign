# The Business Manager

**Carmen Santos** serves as Business Manager at St. Joseph Parish, responsible for the temporal well-being of the entire operation. She manages payroll for 10 staff members, tracks every income and expense category, reconciles bank accounts, prepares monthly financial reports for Fr. Michael and the finance council, and ensures the parish remains financially sustainable. A Filipino immigrant who worked her way through accounting school while raising three children, Carmen is whip-smart with numbers and deeply committed to stewarding the parish's resources with integrity. She's naturally pro-social—people genuinely enjoy working with her, and she has a gift for explaining complex financial matters in ways that non-accountants can understand. Her desk is organized chaos: stacks of invoices, budget spreadsheets open on two monitors, sticky notes reminding her of upcoming bills, and a rosary she prays during her lunch break.

Carmen's biggest challenge is staying focused amid constant interruptions and competing priorities. She'll be deep into reconciling the wedding stipend account when Teresa rushes in with an urgent question about ordering supplies, or Fr. Michael needs her to quickly review a contract, or a parishioner calls about a donation receipt. She's detail-oriented by training and temperament, but easily pulled in multiple directions, which creates low-level anxiety about missing something important. She worries constantly about financial sustainability—the diocese's insurance premiums keep rising, utility costs are unpredictable, and donations haven't kept pace with inflation. Every expense, including new software or subscriptions, gets scrutinized: "Can we really afford this? Is there a free alternative? What's the ROI?" What Carmen needs is software that doesn't add another subscription to the budget, that integrates cleanly with existing systems without requiring her to manually sync data between platforms, and that helps her track sacramental-related revenues and expenses (wedding fees, funeral stipends, baptism donations) in a way that connects to the bigger financial picture. She's bright enough to learn any system, but she needs it to not be another thing demanding her constantly divided attention.
