# The Bishops' Conference Staff Member

**Margaret Sullivan** has spent 15 years at the national bishops' conference, the last six as a Program Coordinator in the Secretariat for Divine Worship. She holds a master's degree in theology from a Catholic university and spent several years before her conference work in diocesan religious education, where she developed curricula, trained catechists, and helped parishes implement sacramental preparation programs. She knows what parish life looks like from the inside, even if those days feel increasingly distant.

Her work now operates at a more abstract level. Days are filled with meetings—committee meetings, inter-office meetings, calls with diocesan worship directors—and documents: guidelines, responses to inquiries, reviews of proposed liturgical resources. She helps coordinate the conference's relationship with various Catholic organizations and assists with communications about liturgical matters. The work is important, she believes deeply in that, but it's several layers removed from the parish hall where she once felt most connected.

Margaret is genuinely faith-motivated. She didn't take a conference job for the salary or the prestige; she took it because she believes the Church's worship matters, and someone needs to ensure that liturgical resources are supported, protected, and made accessible to the faithful. She has real energy for this mission, and colleagues appreciate her combination of theological knowledge and practical sensibility.

One of her recurring responsibilities involves managing permissions for liturgical and biblical content. The conference holds copyrights on translations, lectionary texts, and other liturgical materials, and requests to use this content have increased steadily as Catholic apps, websites, and software tools have proliferated. Each request requires discernment: Is this organization trustworthy? Will they represent the texts accurately? Is this a commercial venture or a ministry? What precedent does approval set? She's been part of granting permissions before—including for digital tools that are now widely used—but each situation is different, and she takes the responsibility seriously.

Margaret lives in the tension between "rules and process" and "mission first." Some days she leans toward protection: these texts are sacred, accuracy matters, and loose permissions could lead to misrepresentation of the Church's worship. Other days she leans toward access: if a tool helps parishes celebrate the sacraments more beautifully, isn't that exactly what this content exists for? The pendulum swings depending on the request, the requestor, and honestly, how her week is going. She's learned that both instincts are valid and that wisdom lies in holding them together.

Her concerns about any new tool seeking permissions are predictable: accuracy of liturgical content, theological correctness, and whether the application will be maintained responsibly over time. She's seen projects launch with enthusiasm and fade into neglect, leaving outdated or incorrect liturgical texts floating around the internet. She doesn't want to contribute to that problem.

What would make her say yes? Seeing that the tool genuinely serves parishes. Knowing that a priest is involved in development. Evidence that the team understands liturgical theology, not just software. A clear explanation of how the content will be used and how accuracy will be maintained. And perhaps most importantly, a sense that this isn't just another commercial venture extracting value from Church resources, but a genuine ministry that happens to take digital form.

Margaret doesn't think of herself as a gatekeeper—she prefers "steward"—but she knows that's effectively her role. Requests come to her desk, and she has to decide. She tries to remember that behind every permission request is someone who cares enough about the Church's worship to build something, and that deserves respect even when the answer is no. When the answer is yes, she hopes she's helping the liturgy reach people in ways she never could from her conference office. That's the mission, after all. That's why she's still here after 15 years.
