## Phase II: Email to Friends (Feedback Request)

**Purpose:** Reach friends who know Josh well, explain the project, ask for honest feedback
**Length:** One paragraph + ask
**Tone:** Personal but more detailed, showing vulnerability and asking for help

### For Parish Priest

**Subject:** Quick favor? Need your eyes on something I'm building

Hey Fr. Michael,

I've been working on something I'd love your feedback on. You know how sacramental preparation involves juggling a million details across email threads, paper files, and scattered spreadsheets? I'm building Outward Sign—a simple tool that helps you and your team prepare for weddings, funerals, baptisms, and other sacraments without things falling through the cracks. It organizes all the details (participants, readings, scripts, schedules), helps everyone stay on the same page, and puts a complete printed binder in the sacristy when you need it. I know you don't have time for complicated software, so I'm designing it to be dead simple. Would you be willing to poke around and give me honest feedback? I really need to know if this actually solves problems or if I'm building something nobody needs.

Thanks for considering it—your opinion means a lot.

Josh

### For Business Manager

**Subject:** Need your sharp eye on a parish tool I'm building

Hi Carmen,

I'm reaching out because I really value your practical wisdom about what parishes actually need. I've been developing a tool called Outward Sign that helps manage sacramental preparation (weddings, funerals, baptisms, etc.) and tracks the associated fees, stipends, and donations. I know you're constantly weighing whether new tools are worth the cost and complexity, so I wanted you to know: there's no subscription fee, it's designed to be straightforward to use, and it helps keep sacramental finances organized without you having to manually sync data everywhere. I'm trying to build something that actually makes your life easier rather than adding to your plate. Would you be willing to take a look and give me your honest thoughts? I need to know if this is genuinely useful or just another thing that sounds good in theory but doesn't work in practice.

I'd really appreciate your feedback—you understand parish operations better than most.

Josh

### For Pastoral Associate

**Subject:** Built something for sacramental prep—need your expert opinion

Teresa,

I'm working on a project that's been on my heart for a while, and I immediately thought of you because nobody understands sacramental preparation like you do. It's called Outward Sign, and it's designed to organize all the details you manage for weddings, funerals, baptisms, and other liturgies—the participants, readings, music selections, scripts, schedules, everything. My goal is to give you the control and organization you need while taking some of the mental burden off your shoulders. It automatically generates the complete printed binders you prepare so carefully, keeps everyone coordinated, and makes sure nothing gets missed. I know how much you care about getting every detail right, and I want to build something that supports that excellence without adding to your stress. Would you be willing to try it out and give me brutally honest feedback? I need to know what works, what doesn't, and what I'm missing.

Your insight would mean the world to me.

Josh

**Tone:** Warm but professional, clear value proposition

### For Parish Priest

**Subject:** Simplify Sacramental Preparation at Your Parish

Dear Father,

Every priest knows the challenge: you want to provide beautiful, meaningful sacramental experiences for your parishioners, but coordinating the details across weddings, funerals, baptisms, and other liturgies means juggling email threads, paper files, spreadsheets, and constant follow-ups.

Hi Carmen,

Parish business managers like you keep everything running—payroll, budgets, reports, compliance—while constantly evaluating whether new tools are worth the investment.

### For Pastoral Associate

**Subject:** The Sacramental Preparation Tool You've Been Waiting For

Dear Teresa,

You know what it takes to prepare a beautiful liturgy. Every wedding binder must be perfect. Every funeral script ready in the sacristy. Every baptism certificate filed correctly. Every detail matters because these moments matter—and when everything comes together flawlessly, families are moved, liturgies are beautiful, and your ministry makes a lasting impact.

But keeping track of everything—participants, readings, schedules, scripts, families, follow-ups—across dozens of sacraments each year is exhausting. You carry so much in your head and across scattered notes, and the mental burden never stops.

**Outward Sign is built specifically for people like you who care deeply about sacramental preparation.**

It gives you:
- **Complete organization** for weddings, funerals, baptisms, quinceañeras, and more—all in one place
- **Perfect printed binders** generated automatically with readings, scripts, schedules, and participant details
- **Control over every detail** while reducing the mental burden of tracking everything manually
- **Bilingual support** (English & Spanish) for diverse parish communities
- **Peace of mind** knowing nothing will be missed or forgotten

You pour your heart into this ministry. Outward Sign is designed to support your excellence, honor your attention to detail, and help you create the beautiful liturgies you envision—without the overwhelm.
