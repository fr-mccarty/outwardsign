## Best Practices by Role

### For Parish Priests (Fr. Michael)

**Your Role:** Final approver, presider at celebrations

**Best Practices:**
1. **Review, Don't Create:** Let your pastoral associate or staff create events, you review and approve
2. **Print Early:** Download and print scripts 2-3 days before celebrations (not last-minute)
3. **Use Notes Section:** Add personal homily notes or reminders in the guidelines section
4. **Mobile Access:** Bookmark the site on your phone for quick access on the go
5. **Communicate Preferences:** Tell your team which readings you prefer for common situations

**Time Commitment:**
- Setup: 5-10 minutes (let staff handle most)
- Per event review: 2-3 minutes
- Print scripts: 1 minute each

**Pro Tip:** Have your pastoral associate create a test wedding and walk through it together (15 minutes) so you both understand the workflow.

### For Pastoral Associates (Maria)

**Your Role:** Primary event coordinator, detail manager

**Best Practices:**
1. **Create Templates:** Build reusable templates for common wedding/funeral readings combinations
2. **Standardize Guidelines:** Create standard guideline text for common situations
3. **Batch Entry:** Set aside 1 hour/week to enter multiple upcoming events at once
4. **Quality Control:** Review scripts before printing—check for typos, verify lector names
5. **Communication Hub:** Use the Notes section to track communication with families
6. **Backup Everything:** Export PDFs and Word docs for your records (store in parish files)
7. **Stay Ahead:** Aim to have events created 2-3 weeks in advance

**Time Commitment:**
- Setup: 30-45 minutes (full detailed setup)
- Per wedding: 20-25 minutes
- Per funeral: 15-20 minutes (often urgent)
- Per baptism: 15 minutes
- Weekly maintenance: 30-60 minutes

**Pro Tip:** Create a checklist for each event type (wedding checklist, funeral checklist) and keep it in a document. As you complete each Outward Sign step, check it off.

**Dealing with Perfectionism:**
- It's okay if the first few events take longer—you're learning
- Don't over-customize initially—use defaults and refine over time
- Export Word doc if you need to make last-minute tweaks
- Remember: A good script delivered on time beats a perfect script delivered late

### For Business Managers (Carmen)

**Your Role:** Evaluate ROI, manage budget, ensure sustainability

**Best Practices:**
1. **Track Time Savings:** Document how long events took to create before vs. after Outward Sign
2. **Calculate ROI:**
   - Before: 8 hours per wedding (scattered docs, emails, formatting)
   - After: 25 minutes per wedding
   - Savings: 7.75 hours × $25/hour = $193.75 per wedding
   - Annual savings (20 weddings): ~$3,875
3. **Monitor Adoption:** Check weekly—is staff actually using it?
4. **Export Data:** Periodically export calendar or event data for parish records
5. **Security Check:** Ensure team members have appropriate permission levels
6. **Backup Policy:** Establish routine for exporting and backing up important scripts

**Time Commitment:**
- Setup: 10 minutes (quick overview)
- Monthly check-in: 15 minutes (review usage, calculate savings)

**ROI Report Template:**

| Metric | Before Outward Sign | After Outward Sign | Savings |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Time per wedding | 8 hours | 0.4 hours | 7.6 hours |
| Time per funeral | 6 hours | 0.3 hours | 5.7 hours |
| Time per baptism | 3 hours | 0.25 hours | 2.75 hours |
| **Annual time saved** | - | - | **~200 hours** |
| **Annual cost saved** ($25/hour) | - | - | **~$5,000** |
| Software cost | - | $0 | - |
| **Net savings** | - | - | **$5,000/year** |

### Workflow Questions

A: Currently, create two separate events (one in English, one in Spanish). Bilingual templates are coming.

## Troubleshooting

### Login & Account Issues

**Problem: I forgot my password**
- Click "Forgot Password" on login page
- Enter your email
- Check email for reset link (check spam)
- Create new password

**Problem: I'm locked out of my account**
- Too many failed login attempts? Wait 15 minutes and try again
- Still locked? Email support@outwardsign.church with your email address

### Event Creation Issues

**Problem: I can't find the person I'm looking for in the picker**
- They might not be in your directory yet—click "Create New Person" in the picker
- Check spelling (search is case-insensitive but spelling matters)
- Try searching by last name only

**Problem: The event date picker won't let me select a date**
- Make sure you're selecting a future date (can't create events in the past by default)
- Check your time zone setting in Settings → Parish

**Problem: My script is missing information**
- Go back to Edit mode and check all required fields are filled
- Make sure you saved after making changes
- Readings missing? Add them in the Readings section

### Printing & Export Issues

**Problem: The PDF download isn't working**
- Try a different browser (Chrome works best)
- Disable browser pop-up blocker temporarily
- Right-click "Download PDF" and choose "Save link as"

**Problem: The script formatting looks wrong in Word**
- Word may adjust formatting on open—that's normal
- Use the PDF for final printing (better formatting)
- Word export is meant for making custom edits, not printing

**Problem: Printed script is cut off or doesn't fit on page**
- Check your printer settings: Select "Fit to page" or "Shrink to fit"
- Make sure paper size is set to Letter (8.5" × 11")
