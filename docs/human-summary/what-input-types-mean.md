# What Input Types Mean

When you're setting up a new event type—say, a wedding or a funeral—you're essentially designing a form. What information do you need to collect? Who's involved? When and where does it happen? What readings will be used?

Each piece of information is a "field," and each field has a type. The type determines what kind of data goes there and how staff will enter it.

Here's what each one means in plain English.

## The "Who" Fields

### Person
Pick someone from the parish directory. Used for roles like bride, groom, presider, lector, witness, or family contact. You're selecting one specific human being.

### Group
Pick a ministry group—like "St. Cecilia Choir" or "Altar Servers." The whole group, not an individual. Useful when you need a team assigned rather than a specific person.

## The "Where" Field

### Location
Pick a place from the parish's locations list—Main Church, Parish Hall, Chapel of Repose, St. Joseph Room. Anywhere something could happen.

## The "When" Fields

### Calendar Event
This is the big one. It bundles together a date, a time, and a location into one field. Think "Rehearsal: Friday at 6pm in the Church" or "Ceremony: Saturday at 2pm in the Main Church."

Most event types have at least one calendar event field—often two or three. A wedding might have fields for rehearsal, ceremony, and reception. A funeral might have vigil and Mass.

One of these gets marked as "primary" and shows up on the parish calendar. The rest are tracked but stay behind the scenes.

### Date
Just a date, no time. Used when you need to record something like "Date Paperwork Received" or "Anniversary of Baptism."

### Time
Just a time, no date. Less common on its own, but available when needed.

## The "What" Fields

### Content
Pick something from the Content Library—a scripture reading, a psalm, a blessing, a ceremony text. The library is tagged and searchable, so staff can filter by "Old Testament" or "Wedding Readings" and pick the right one.

This is how liturgical texts get assigned to events without retyping anything.

### Petition
Create or select prayers of the faithful specific to this event. Staff can start from a template, generate with AI, or write from scratch. The petitions then flow into the printed script.

### List Item
Pick from a custom dropdown list that the parish defines. "Type of Music" might offer Organ, Piano, Guitar, A Cappella. "Flower Arrangement" might offer Full, Partial, None.

These lists are created in Settings and can be reused across event types. Any time you need a finite set of predefined options, this is your field.

### Document
Attach a file—a signed permission form, a baptismal certificate, a marriage license. Uploaded documents are stored with the event and accessible later.

## The "Basic Data" Fields

### Text
A single line of text. Notes, special instructions, a phone number, whatever doesn't fit elsewhere.

### Rich Text
Multiple lines of text. Same idea as Text, but with room to breathe. Good for longer notes or descriptions.

### Number
A number. Might be "Number of Guests Expected" or "Years Married" for an anniversary blessing.

### Yes/No
A simple toggle. "Music requested?" Yes or no. "Reception on parish grounds?" Yes or no.

## The "Not Really a Field" Field

### Spacer
This isn't a field at all—it's a visual divider. Drop one between sections of a long form to give staff a visual break. "Liturgy Details" up here, line, "Reception Details" down there.

No data, just breathing room.

## Why This Matters

When a parish admin sets up an event type, they're choosing these field types to match what they actually need to track. A funeral needs different information than a quinceañera. A baptism form looks nothing like a Mass scheduling form.

By picking the right types, the admin builds exactly the form they need—no more, no less. Staff then fills in the blanks, and the system knows how to store it, search it, and print it.

It's like a filing system where every drawer is labeled correctly and every file goes exactly where it belongs.
