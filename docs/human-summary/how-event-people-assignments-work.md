# How People Get Assigned to Events

Picture a wedding. There's a bride, a groom, a priest, two witnesses, a lector, maybe a cantor. Now picture a Sunday with three Masses—8am, 10am, and noon. Each one needs a lector, but probably not the same person reading at all three.

These are two very different scheduling problems, and Outward Sign handles both.

## The Big Idea: Two Kinds of Roles

Some roles belong to the *event itself*. The bride is the bride whether we're talking about the rehearsal on Friday or the ceremony on Saturday. She doesn't change. Same with the groom, the presider, and the witnesses. These are **event-level roles**—set once, applied everywhere.

Other roles belong to *specific times*. The lector at 8am Mass is probably not the same person as the lector at noon. The readings are identical, but different people show up to proclaim them. These are **time-slot roles**—set individually for each occurrence.

That's it. That's the whole concept. Every role in every event type falls into one of these two buckets.

## How It Plays Out

**A wedding** has a rehearsal and a ceremony—two dates on the calendar. But the bride and groom don't change between them. You assign them once to the wedding, and they're automatically part of both. The presider, the witnesses, the musicians—same deal.

**A Sunday Mass** might have three times on the schedule. The readings are the same (it's the same Sunday, after all), but each time slot needs its own ministers. You assign John to read at 5pm Saturday, Mary at 8am Sunday, and Bob at 10:30am. Three different assignments, all for the same "event."

The system knows which roles work which way because each event type defines it upfront. Weddings say "bride and groom are event-level." Masses say "lector is per-time-slot." You don't have to think about it when you're doing the actual scheduling.

## What About the Calendar?

Not every date on an event belongs on the public parish calendar. The wedding rehearsal? Probably not. The ceremony? Absolutely. A funeral vigil? Maybe not. The funeral Mass? Yes.

Each scheduled time has a simple toggle: show it on the calendar or don't. Staff decides. The public sees what makes sense.

## Why This Matters

For staff, it means less duplicate data entry and clearer oversight. Assign the wedding party once. Assign Mass ministers per time slot. See who's doing what across the whole parish.

For parishioners, it means one place to check all their upcoming commitments. "When am I reading? When am I serving? What's on my plate this month?" One list, sorted by date.

For the system, it means everything is searchable. Want to know every event Father Mike is presiding at this quarter? Easy. Want to see if the 10:30am Mass has a lector yet? Done.

It's a simple idea—some roles stick to the event, others stick to the time—but it makes parish scheduling dramatically less chaotic.
