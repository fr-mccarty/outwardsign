# Project Vision: Outward Sign

## The Name and the Mission

"An outward sign instituted by Christ to give grace." This is the traditional Catholic definition of a sacrament, and it captures the heart of what Outward Sign exists to accomplish. The sacraments—Baptism, Marriage, Holy Eucharist, Anointing of the Sick—are not administrative tasks to be managed. They are encounters with the living God, moments when heaven touches earth through visible signs and sacred ritual. These celebrations, along with sacramentals like presentations and quinceañeras, form the core activity of every Catholic parish.

## The Problem We Solve

For too long, parishes have managed these sacred moments with scattered documents, endless email chains, fragmented spreadsheets, and last-minute scrambling. Wedding coordinators maintain separate binders. Funeral directors work from different templates. The presider arrives at the sacristy unsure if the script includes the correct readings, the proper names, or the family's specific requests. Communication breaks down between staff, families, and celebrants. Beautiful celebrations become sources of stress rather than joy.

The problem isn't a lack of care—it's a lack of systems that honor both the sacred nature of these moments and the practical realities of parish life.

## What Outward Sign Does

Outward Sign is a comprehensive sacrament and sacramental management platform designed specifically for Catholic parishes. At its heart, it transforms preparation into collaboration and chaos into clarity.

The platform centers around five major sacramental celebrations: **Weddings**, **Funerals**, **Baptisms**, **Presentations** (a Latino tradition of presenting children to the community), and **Quinceañeras**. Each celebration type has a dedicated workflow that guides staff through every step of preparation—from initial contact with families through the moment the presider picks up the printed binder in the sacristy.

Supporting these workflows is a robust **People directory** that maintains relationships between participants, families, presiders, coordinators, and staff. Rather than re-entering contact information for every celebration, the parish builds a living directory that grows with the community. **Events** can be created for rehearsals, receptions, and the celebrations themselves, with full date, time, and **Location** management. The **Readings library** provides access to scripture passages, complete with pericopes, translations, and the ability to assign readers for each celebration.

The platform includes **Mass management** and **Mass Intentions** modules, allowing parishes to track regular liturgical celebrations alongside special sacramental events. A unified **Calendar** view brings everything together, displaying all parish sacramental activity in one place and generating .ics feeds that integrate with external calendar systems.

## From Planning to Print

One of Outward Sign's most powerful features is its **liturgical script system**. Once a celebration is planned—participants identified, readings selected, special prayers or petitions added—the platform automatically generates a complete, beautifully formatted liturgical script. These aren't generic templates. They're professional documents that include every reading, every response, every direction the presider needs, properly formatted with liturgical typography and paging.

Scripts can be exported to **PDF** for immediate printing or **Word documents** for final editing. The goal is simple: when the priest or deacon arrives at the sacristy, they find a printed binder with everything they need to celebrate the sacrament with excellence, prepared collaboratively by the entire parish team.

## Built for Collaboration and Communication

Outward Sign recognizes that sacramental preparation is inherently collaborative. Coordinators work with families. Presiders review scripts. Music directors select hymns. The platform supports this teamwork with shared preparation workflows, role-based permissions, and clear communication channels.

The platform is **fully bilingual** (English and Spanish), recognizing the multicultural reality of American Catholic parishes. It's **free and open source**, ensuring that cost never prevents a parish from celebrating sacraments with excellence. And it's built with **dark mode support** and **mobile-responsive design**, meeting staff where they work—whether at a desk or on the move.

## The Vision

The sacraments are the core activity of the Catholic parish. Their proper celebration at every step—planning, preparation, communication, and execution—is evangelizing work. When parishes prepare well, families experience joy. When communication is clear, staff work together seamlessly. When the presider holds a beautiful script, the celebration itself becomes a sign of the Church's care and Christ's presence.

Outward Sign exists to make these moments not just manageable, but beautiful.
