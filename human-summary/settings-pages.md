# Outward Sign Settings Pages Summary

This document provides an overview of all settings pages available in the Outward Sign application. The settings are organized into a central hub accessible at `/settings`.

## User Preferences

Allows individual users to customize their personal experience. Users can set their preferred interface language (English, Spanish, French, or Latin) and view their account information including email, user ID, account creation date, and when settings were last updated.

## Parish Events

Configure event types for non-liturgical parish activities such as Bible Study sessions, Fundraisers, Religious Education classes, and Parish Meetings. Each event type becomes a reusable template with custom fields, settings, and printable scripts. Events created with a type inherit all its configurations.

## Special Liturgies

Configure sacramental celebrations including Weddings, Baptisms, Funerals, and Quinceañeras. Also includes other liturgical celebrations like Benediction, Stations of the Cross, and Holy Hours. Similar to Parish Events, each special liturgy type serves as a template with customizable fields and scripts.

## Custom Lists

Manage dropdown options used throughout the application. Create and maintain lists for event field choices such as songs, readings, locations, and other frequently-used options. These lists populate selection fields when staff create or edit events.

## Petition Settings

Configure default petition templates for various liturgical occasions. Petitions are the prayers of the faithful used during liturgical celebrations. Templates can be created, organized, and assigned to specific contexts for quick insertion into Mass and event scripts.

## Parish Settings

Central hub for parish administration containing four tabs:
- **Parish Settings**: Edit parish name, city, state, country, and liturgical calendar locale (affects which liturgical calendar events are imported)
- **Mass Intentions**: Configure quick-amount buttons for recording Mass intention offerings
- **Petitions**: Manage petition templates directly from this interface
- **Users**: Invite new parish members, manage roles (Admin, Staff, Ministry-Leader), configure module access, and remove members

## Mass Configuration

A dedicated hub for configuring Mass-related settings with four subsections:
- **Recurring Schedule**: Set up regular Mass times for each day of the week
- **Role Assignment Patterns**: Define templates for assigning liturgical roles at different Mass types
- **Role Definitions**: Configure available liturgical roles (Lector, Cantor, Extraordinary Minister, etc.)
- **Ministry Volunteers**: View and manage parishioners who serve in liturgical ministries, including their availability preferences and blackout dates

## Content Library

Manage reusable liturgical content including readings, prayers, ceremony texts, and other materials. Content can be organized with tags and inserted into event scripts. Supports bilingual content for parishes serving diverse communities.

## Category Tags

An administrative feature for organizing content and petitions. Tags enable filtering and categorizing materials in the Content Library and Petition Templates. Only administrators can create and manage category tags.

## Event Templates

View and manage saved event templates. When staff create events with commonly-used configurations, they can save those as templates for quick reuse. Templates store field values, liturgical role assignments, and other event details for efficient event creation.
